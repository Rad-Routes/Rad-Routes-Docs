## Dr. Quine Medicine

Here is an example of a fun litte R.A.D. Route quine:

Simply running;

```
rr -r q2
```

Will produce the source code, which is a child process that spawns, and runs it's own R.A.D. Route. It will proceed to execute and kill itself again every 2 seconds.

Lets take a look at the source code from ***Dr. Quine "Medicine Man"***

```
const { exec } = require('child_process');

let exe = ()=> {exec(`rr -r q2`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    
    console.log(stdout)
    
    console.error(stderr)
    
    console.error(error)
    })}
setTimeout(() => {
    
exe()
  
}, 2000);
```

This code imports the child_process module in node, and then runs its own R.A.D. Route. This child_process is never killed so the first one will keep its print out, while the new child_process run in the backround.

### Check your activity monitor on MacOS, or top on Linux, or Process Manager on Windows.

In your process monitor runner manager, you can see how this Quine, and how R.A.D. Routes itselt runs.

```
The initial Runner is written in Python, it runs another Python runner to get your R.A.D. Route, and passes that request to node to execute.

In this case the node process is invoking the original Python runner which restarts this loop.

This process is repeated every 2 seconds until either the computer runs out of memory, or the process is killed.
