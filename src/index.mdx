# What is a R.A.D. Route?

---

R.A.D. Routes is a code sharing and execution platform:

- **R.** Random

- **A.** Access

- **D.** Data

- **Route** The way R.A.D. is accessed via your/the communities routes. Via the R.A.D. Routes Runner, which contacts our RESTful style API to pull your created route from the R.A.D. cloud, and run them on your machine.


## Use Case

---

R.A.D. Routes is ment to be used mostly for shortish, and normally one file scripts that you want to execute frequently on your computer, server, or team projects.

- Orcastrate your containers easily and edit deployments on the fly

- Spin up a Docker, or React starter file consistently, reliably, and securely.

- Run frequently used script within an IT team to cut down on copy paste fatigue
